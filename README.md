ðŸŽ¹ JavaScript Series - Part 3: Build a Virtual Piano with Just JS! ðŸŽµâœ¨

Ever wondered how to create a simple yet interactive piano using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript? Hereâ€™s a fun project where I dynamically generate 24 piano keys and play sound on each clickâ€”just like a real piano! ðŸŽ¼ðŸŽ¶

ðŸ”¥ Key Features:
âœ… Dynamically Generated Keys â€“ No manual coding of keys; JavaScript creates them automatically!
âœ… Seamless Audio Playback â€“ Click a key, and it plays the corresponding piano sound instantly. ðŸŽµ
âœ… Black & White Key Styling â€“ Just like a real piano, keys are styled accordingly.
âœ… Lightweight & Efficient â€“ No external libraries, just pure JavaScript!

This is a perfect beginner-friendly project to understand event listeners, DOM manipulation, and working with audio files in JavaScript. ðŸš€

In this project, I have integrated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive virtual piano. Additionally, I have provided a folder containing piano key sounds. Download the folder and use these sounds to build your own virtual piano. Enjoy experimenting with music and coding!
